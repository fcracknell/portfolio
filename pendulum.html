        <h2>Swing-Up and LQR Control Simulation of an Inverted Pendulum</h2>
        <h3>Introduction and Project Overview</h3>
        <p class="details__text">
          Control is a fundamental element of aerospace engineering and plays a major
          role in providing a solution to a broad range of real-world challenges such
          as flight dynamics and spacecraft attitude control. This project uses the 
          classic inverted pendulum, a well-documented and fundamental control 
          problem, as a springboard from which to dive in and learn more about what 
          it takes to tackle these real world control problems.
        </p>

         <p class="details__text">
          Using a custom Python physics simulation and MATLAB-based controller design,
          this project saw the successful implementation of an energy-based swing-up
          strategy, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and ultimately a 
          full-state linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller to stabilise both 
          the pendulum angle and cart position simultaneously.

        <h3>Background Theory</h3>
        <p class="details__text">
          The inverted pendulum system consists of a cart with a given mass, constrained
          to move in one dimension along the horizontal direction, and a pendulum with 
          some other mass connected to this cart by (in this case) a massless rod. The 
          desired state of this system is for the pendulum to be vertically upright with 
          no angular velocity, and the cart to also be stationary at some desired 
          horizontal position. The challenge of the inverted pendulum problem arises 
          when we restrict ourselves to only being able to control the system by 
          applying a force to the cart.
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          Ordinarily however, think about balancing a tall broomstick using only the 
          palm of your hand and with the brush in the air. When the system is inverted,
          the inherent instability of this state makes it incredibly difficult for 
          it to be maintained. For this reason, it makes sense to begin with a 
          pendulum in a downwards position, as this is the realistic natural state 
          for a pendulum you may come across in real life.
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          Therefore, it is necessary to find some way of swinging up the pendulum in a 
          precise enough manner that allows it to approach this desired state. In fact,
          it turns out that using some basic energy conservation principles and a bit
          of maths, not only is it possible to precisely swing-up the pendulum, but 
          it is also possible to control the maintain the desired upright position of
          the pendulum by merely applying some variable force to the cart.
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          By drawing an analogy with a roller coaster, we can think of the energy of
          the pendulum as being broken down into two parts: gravitational potential 
          energy, and kinetic energy. We therefore define the desired energy to be 
          equal to the energy of the stationary pendulum in its inverted state, purely
          gravitational potential energy. Returning to the rollercoaster, if at 
          some point on its way up an incline, the sum of its gravitational 
          potential energy and kinetic energy is greater than orequal to the 
          gravitational potential energy at the top of the incline, then we know that
          it will make it up the hill. Applying this to the pendulum, we apply a 
          force to the cart in a direction that accelerates the pendulum, therefore
          increasing its kinetic energy. Likewise, once the sum of the pendulumâ€™s 
          gravitational and kinetic energy is exactly equal to that in the desired 
          state, the force is stopped and the pendulum swings freely, settling gently
          in the desired upright state. The equation for the pendulum energy is 
          given by Equation (2) of [1], as shown below.
        </p>

        <div class="details__image-box">

        </div>

        <p class="details__text">
          With this definition of the pendulum energy, we apply a force to the cart 
          based on the difference with the current pendulum energy and the desired 
          energy, as well as some defined gain. This force acts in a direction that 
          depends on the sign of both the pendulum angular velocity and the pendulum 
          angle, ensuring it only acts to accelerate and hence add energy to the 
          pendulum. This force is then restricted by some maximum acceleration, 
          representing the maximum operating ability of some motor in a real world 
          application to accelerate the cart. The equation for this force is given 
          by Equation (4) of [1] below.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p class="details__text">
          Once the pendulum has been swung-up, the challenge shifts to actively 
          maintaining the inherently unstable upright position of the now inverted
          pendulum. This is where control methods become essential.
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          To Stabilise the pendulum, we implement a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR),
          a full-state feedback control strategy that allows both the pendulum angle
          and cart position to be controlled. Alternatively, a more simple 
          proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller could be implemented, but
          its authority is limited to just the pendulum angle, meaning the cart 
          continues moving on into infinity!
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          Without getting too far into the details, an LQR controller computes a way
          of applying force to the cart purely based on the current state of the system
          (cart position, cart velocity, pendulum angle, and pendulum angular velocity).
          It achieves this by modelling the dynamics of the cart-pendulum system as a 
          set of linearised state-space equations about the upright equilibrium position.
          The applied force (system input) is calculated by each state variable 
          (cart position, cart velocity, pendulum angle, and pendulum angular velocity)
          by a given constant (gain) and summing the result. The state variables 
          (system output) are then observed once more and a new input force is 
          calculated, forming a closed-loop control algorithm that stabilises when the
          pendulum is stationary and upright, and the cart is stationary.
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          The control law for the input force u to the cart takes the form:

        <p class="details__text">
          Where <strong>K</strong> is the gain that corresponds to each state variable 
          represented by <strong>x</strong>.
          For further details regarding PID and LQR control in this context, see [3].
        </p>

        <p class="details__text">
          Combining both the swing-up and inverted control routines, what results is 
          a smooth and mathematically optimal strategy that gracefully positions the 
          pendulum into its upright position, and precisely maintains this 
          configuration whilst stabilising to the desired position.

          The LQR controller successfully stabilizes the pendulum after the energy-based swing-up phase. Control effort
          and state contributions are visualized using MATLAB plots, highlighting the role of each state in the
